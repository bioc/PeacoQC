## Introduction

The PeacoQC package provides quality control functions that will check 
for monotonic increasing channels, that will remove outliers and unstable 
events introduced due to e.g. clogs, speed changes etc. during the measurement 
of your sample. It also provides the functionality of visualising the quality
control result of only one sample and the visualisation of the results of 
multiple samples in one experiment.

## Installing PeacoQC

```{r setup}
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("https://github.com/saeyslab/PeacoQC")

library(PeacoQC)

```

## Standard pre-processing and quality control pipeline

The following pipeline is recommended to use for pre-processing your data.
The pipeline starts with a flowframe (flow cytometry or mass cytometry data) 
and will first remove margins, then it will compensate and transform while 
ending with the PeacoQC quality control. This will give back a list with the 
cleaned flowframe and the different parameter settings, it will also save the 
flowframe in a new fcs file and it will make a plot of the quality control for 
this sample.

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
# Specify flowframe path and read your flowframe
fileName <- system.file("extdata", "111.fcs", package = "PeacoQC")
ff <- flowCore::read.FCS(fileName)


# Determine channels on which quality control should be done
channels <- c(1,3,5:14,18,21)

# Store compensation matrix
compensation_matrix <- flowCore::description(ff)$SPILL

# Store transformation list
transformation_list <- flowCore::estimateLogicle(ff, 
                        colnames(flowCore::description(ff)$SPILL))


# Run PeacoQC and save the cleaned flowframe as an fcs file and plot the results
# of this quality control step.
peacoqc_res <- PeacoQC(
    ff = ff,
    compensation_matrix = compensation_matrix,
    transformation_list = transformation_list,
    channels = channels,
    determine_good_cells = "all",
    save_fcs = TRUE,
    plot = TRUE)


# Filtered flowframe is stored in peacoqc_res$FinalFF and can be used for 
# further analysis.
ff <- peacoqc_res$FinalFF


```

The code underneath specifies the functions that are used in the PeacoQC 
function. You can use all these functions individually if you need to alter 
something specific but it is easier to use the bigger PeacoQC workflow function.

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
# Specify flowframe path and read your flowframe
fileName <- system.file("extdata", "111.fcs", package = "PeacoQC")
ff <- flowCore::read.FCS(fileName)


# Determine channels on which quality control should be done
channels <- c(1,3,5:14,18,21)


# Remove margins
# Make sure you do this before any compensation since the internal parameters
# change and they are neccessary for the RemoveMargins function.
# If this is not possible, you can specify the internal parameters in the 
# channel_specifications parameter.

ff <- RemoveMargins(ff = ff, channels = channels, output = "frame")


# Compensate and transform the data
ff <- flowCore::compensate(ff, flowCore::description(ff)$SPILL)
ff <- flowCore::transform(ff, 
    flowCore::estimateLogicle(ff, colnames(flowCore::description(ff)$SPILL)))


# Run PeacoQC and save the cleaned flowframe as an fcs file and plot the results
# of this quality control step.
peacoqc_res <- PeacoQCSignalStability(
    ff = ff,
    channels = channels,
    determine_good_cells = "all",
    save_fcs = TRUE,
    plot = TRUE)


# Filtered flowframe is stored in peacoqc_res$FinalFF and can be used for 
# further analysis.
ff <- peacoqc_res$FinalFF


```

## Mass cytometry data

If you want to clean mass cytometry data files you should alter some parameters.
The compensation matrix should be set to NULL and the parameter remove_zeros 
should be set to TRUE. The IT_limit will range between 0.6 and 0.65 since some 
channels will be more sparse than flow cytometry results. 
The time_units parameter in the plot function should be also be altered since
mass cytometry data is typically measures for a longer time than the flow 
cytometry data. You should play a bit with the parameter until you don't see
the picketfencing effect anymore in the event rate plot (Top left in the 
overview).

```{r}
# # Example of how the code could look for mass cytometry data
# 
# ff <- read.FCS(File)
# 
# # You don't have to remove margin events or compensate the data but you  
# # should transform it
# channels <- c(3,5,6:53)
# 
# transform_list <- flowCore::transformList(
#     colnames(ff)[channels], 
#     flowCore::arcsinhTransform(a = 0, b = 1/5, c = 0))
# 
# peacoqc_results <- PeacoQC(ff, 
#     channels = channels,
#     remove_margins = FALSE,
#     compensation_matrix = NULL,
#     transformation_list = transform_list,
#     IT_limit = 0.6,
#     remove_zeros = TRUE,
#     time_units = 50000)
# 
```


## Large dataset

If you have a large dataset and you want to run your preprocessing pipeline
for multiple files, it is recommended to run it first on a couple of files to 
tweak your parameters. If your dataset inlcudes channels that have a sparse 
pattern (e.g. in mass data), the IT_limit should probably be increased in order 
to be more strict. If it seems that the MAD parameter removes too much, you can
also increase this to make PeacoQC more strict.
It is also recommended to determine your transformlist on one compensated file.

```{r, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}

# Change IT_limit for one compensated and transformed file. 
# (Higher = more strict, lower = less strict)
# The fcs file should not be saved since we are still optimising the parameters
fileName <- system.file("extdata", "111.fcs", package = "PeacoQC")
ff <- flowCore::read.FCS(fileName)

# Determine channels on which quality control should be done
channels <- c(1,3,5:14,18,21)


# Compensate and determine transformation list for one file
compensation_matrix <- flowCore::description(ff)$SPILL
ff_compensated <- flowCore::compensate(ff, compensation_matrix)
transformation_list <- flowCore::estimateLogicle(ff, 
                        colnames(compensation_matrix))


peacoqc_res <- PeacoQC(
    ff,
    channels,
    compensation_matrix = compensation_matrix,
    transformation_list = transformation_list,
    determine_good_cells = "all",
    save_fcs = FALSE,
    plot = TRUE,
    IT_limit = 0.6
)


# This line is to show you what the results are from the PeacoQC run
plot_path <- system.file("extdata", 
    "PeacoQC_111_Comp_Trans.png", 
    package = "PeacoQC")
knitr::include_graphics(plot_path)

# As you can see on the figure, the Isolation Tree analysis removed the first
# part of the data while the MAD analysis did not remove anything.



# You can also change the MAD parameter to a higher value 
# (to make it more strict) or to a lower value (to make it less strict). 
# Since the MAD analysis does not remove something, this is not neccesary now.

# peacoqc_res <- PeacoQC(
#     ff,
#     channels,
#     compensation_matrix = compensation_matrix,
#     transformation_list = transformation_list,
#     determine_good_cells = "all",
#     save_fcs = FALSE,
#     plot = TRUE,
#     MAD = 12
# )



# When the correct parameters are chosen you can run the different files in 
# a for loop

# for (file in files){
#   ff <- flowCore::read.FCS(file)

#   peacoqc_res <- PeacoQC(
#     ff, 
#     channels,
#     compensation_matrix = compensation_matrix,
#     transformation_list = transformation_list,
#     determine_good_cells = "all",
#     IT_limit = 0.6,
#     save_fcs = T,
#     plot = T)
#   
# }

```


## PeacoQCHeatmap

In order to get an overview on how much the quality control removed, 
the PeacoQCHeatmap allows for a visualised representation of the different 
conditions and the different percentages that were removed in different runs.

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=8}
# Find the path to the report that was created by using the PeacoQC function
location <- system.file("extdata", "PeacoQC_report.txt", package = "PeacoQC")

# Make heatmap overview of the quality control run
PeacoQCHeatmap(report_location = location)

# Make heatmap with only the runs of the last test
PeacoQCHeatmap(report_location = location, latest_tests = TRUE)

# Make heatmap with row annotation
PeacoQCHeatmap(report_location = location, 
    row_split = c("r1", "r2", rep("r3",2), rep("r4", 16)))

```



## PlotPeacoQC without quality control

The PlotPeacoQC function can also be used to only display the peaks of the 
different channels without doing any quality control. It can even be used to 
only display the measurements.

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
# Load in compensated and transformed flowframe

fileName <- system.file("extdata", "111_Comp_Trans.fcs", package = "PeacoQC")
ff <- flowCore::read.FCS(fileName)

# Plot only the peaks (No quality control)
PlotPeacoQC(ff, channels, display_peaks = TRUE)

# Plot only the dots of the file
PlotPeacoQC(ff, channels, display_peaks = FALSE)


```
